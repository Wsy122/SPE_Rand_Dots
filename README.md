# SPE_Rand_Dots

This repo contains the experimental programs and data analysis code for "Self-prioritization effect in perceptual matching and discrimination tasks".

## Research Background and Aims
The self-prioritization effect (SPE) refers to the phenomenon whereby self-related stimuli are processed more efficiently than stimuli not related to the self.
This repository contains two experiments examining different aspects of the SPE:
- **Experiment 1**: Examines whether SPE persists in tasks without direct self-relevance and how it interacts with varying levels of task difficulty (matching task + RDM discrimination).
- **Experiment 2**: Investigates whether SPE is modulated by the task relevance of the feature-person association, specifically, whether the self-associated visual feature overlaps with or is independent of the discrimination task target.with a random dot motion task to examine (a) whether the SPE persists in tasks without direct self-relevance, and (b) how this effect interacts with varying levels of task difficulty.

## Experimental Design
### Experiment 1: 
- **2 × 4 × 2 mixed design:**
  - **Within-subject factors**:
    - `Association type`: self-related vs. stranger-related
    - `Difficulty`: 4 levels (very easy, easy, difficult, very difficult)
  - **Between-subject factor**:
    - `Perceptual dimension`: motion vs. color 
### Experiment 2:
- **2 × 2 × 2 within-subject design**:
  - `Association type`: self-related vs. stranger-related
  - `Difficulty`: easy (~85% accuracy threshold) vs. difficult (~70% accuracy threshold)
  - `Task relevance`: target-overlapped vs. target-independent
